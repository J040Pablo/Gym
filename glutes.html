    <h1>Glute Workout</h1>

    <section class = instrucao>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our glute workout routine! This workout targets your glute muscles, helping you strengthen and shape your backside.</p>
    
    <h2>Warm-Up</h2>
    <p>Before starting the workout, it's important to warm up your glute muscles. Here's a simple warm-up routine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>5-10 minutes of light cardio (e.g., brisk walking, cycling)</li>
      <li>10-15 reps of leg swings</li>
      <li>10-15 reps of hip bridges</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Workout</h2>
    <p>Here are some effective exercises for your glutes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Squats:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and lower your hips down as if you were sitting in a chair. Keep your chest up and your weight in your heels as you push back up.</li>
      <li><strong>Lunges:</strong> Step forward with one leg and lower your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push back up to the starting position and repeat on the other side.</li>
      <li><strong>Glute Bridges:</strong> Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top, then lower back down.</li>
      <li><strong>Donkey Kicks:</strong> Start on your hands and knees with your back flat. Lift one leg up towards the ceiling while keeping your knee bent, then lower it back down and repeat on the other side.</li>
    </ol>
